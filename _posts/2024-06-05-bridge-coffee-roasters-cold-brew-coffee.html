<p>&nbsp;As local as I can get!<br /><br />The Brazil Single Origin 01 from Bridge Coffee Roasters, located in my hometown of Ystrad Mynach in the county of Caerphilly, caught my eye recently.</p><h1 style="text-align: left;">Local Coffee for Local People</h1><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhCUBwDcA00ANTOQKOQhy6HIDi7ExOlM0w_6tW-uzWegz9IAyNsAAX20e_Jo9eamDdbpAAx3KLsO2nFwly0i-1IyAWsaa8x080v5Iv6m_GTpeIIiFdyw0Hav1h2Hz0eSfqEtzohZuM5PtIUqZnwShXjCnHeYJBFKKKzqdGWHPAbKP4tvy5tlYbW3UeUr4/s4032/Main%20image.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The Brazil Single Origin 01 from bridge coffee roasters" border="0" data-original-height="2268" data-original-width="4032" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhCUBwDcA00ANTOQKOQhy6HIDi7ExOlM0w_6tW-uzWegz9IAyNsAAX20e_Jo9eamDdbpAAx3KLsO2nFwly0i-1IyAWsaa8x080v5Iv6m_GTpeIIiFdyw0Hav1h2Hz0eSfqEtzohZuM5PtIUqZnwShXjCnHeYJBFKKKzqdGWHPAbKP4tvy5tlYbW3UeUr4/w640-h360/Main%20image.png" title="The Brazil Single Origin 01 from bridge coffee roasters" width="640" /></a></div>Setup and The Taste</h3><p>With 14 hour Cold Brewing Period in my Bodum Cold Brew Coffee Maker, This Brazilian number came out very smooth and very tasty with a nice hint of walnut.<br /><br />Only a bit of Water was needed, and it can be drank black, which is always a winner.</p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Considerations</h3><p>The price per 250g was Â£10.95, which is a bit on the expensive side. However, as of the 23rd of May, Bridge has ceased selling directly to consumers and is only now being sold wholesale.<br /><br />It's a shame, as the coffee was one of the best, but not strong, coffees I've had in a long time.</p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">The Score</h3><p>I shall give Bridge Coffee Roasters Brazil Single Origin 01 4 out of 5 Beans ðŸ«˜</p><br /><br />
