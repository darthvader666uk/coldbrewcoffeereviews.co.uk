<p>The Colombia El Carmen from Hard Lines, located in my home city of Cardiff, was calling out to me. Why?&nbsp;Cherry Bakewell favoured. I have not had a washed coffee since my first review and was very eager to taste it.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Another Local Coffee for the Local people</h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaSo_N5ddSXJh61DxMKlv1ShMEbOTC0Xe-bjhHo1R0VOF-upLAEEypbsEYIsTgk02JJ0kdax_sVlTiQ-rUhWsHTq9AUORtzicw4dt7qATV5Vcmm0eOGBtyhGR01zszlYj4cFcgTMrJ-vnLS0091SrHQ8sr4NCi43izRDj6udoOTokWqpKPZ1jS_C5nVUI/s4032/Main%20image%20(1).png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The Colombia El Carmen from Hard Lines Coffee" border="0" data-original-height="2268" data-original-width="4032" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaSo_N5ddSXJh61DxMKlv1ShMEbOTC0Xe-bjhHo1R0VOF-upLAEEypbsEYIsTgk02JJ0kdax_sVlTiQ-rUhWsHTq9AUORtzicw4dt7qATV5Vcmm0eOGBtyhGR01zszlYj4cFcgTMrJ-vnLS0091SrHQ8sr4NCi43izRDj6udoOTokWqpKPZ1jS_C5nVUI/w640-h360/Main%20image%20(1).png" title="The Colombia El Carmen from Hard Lines Coffee" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><p>With 14 hour Cold Brewing Period in my Bodum Cold Brew Coffee Maker, The Colombia El Carmen from Hard Lines came out exactly as i expected. A very smooth, not so strong but tasted of a&nbsp;Cherry Bakewell.</p><p>There wasn't much extra water needed to dilute it as it came out perfect, and it can be drank black, which is always a winner.</p><p>The price per 250g was Â£11.50, which is a bit on the expensive side. However, if you want a treat and mix it up a little from the norm, this is certainly worth a try.</p><p>I shall give The Colombia El Carmen from Hard Lines&nbsp;4 out of 5 Beans ðŸ«˜</p>
